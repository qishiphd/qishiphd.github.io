I'm a weather/climate/hydrodynamic modeler at Michigan Technological University. My research focuses on investigating the air-sea interaction processes using coupled atmosphere and ocean models as well as remote sensing observations. I have more than 8 years experience in dynamic model development and validation. I'm passionate about scientifc data visualization using python Matplotlib and PyNGL Pakages.
